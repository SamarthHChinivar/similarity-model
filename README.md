# Similarity Model
Similarity Model is one of the projects developed during the RedTron Internship. <br/>

This repository contains a Python implementation of a similarity model that accepts user input at runtime for any random search keyword and displays the top 100 results from a sample CSV file in descending order based on their similarity.

## Opening the Code:
<hr/>
1. Open the Link : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GkPTmbDh4SB_LjmfFDwtwljMtGk5ZBhN#scrollTo=MqYbP1kgjToF

7. Wait for 1-2 min, untill below search box appears. Now, Enter the Required Material and Hit Enter. <br/> <br/>
<img alt='search' src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104615876/224545554-4be3e2a9-16a4-44ef-a219-00e7279b6acd.jpg' /> <br/>
8. After all blocks of code are executed , wait for around 1-2 mins until the file output.json appears as shown below: <br/> <br/>
<img alt='output' src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104615876/224545842-1c04fc07-1800-4e50-8229-d96a7f323b69.jpg' /> <br/>
9. output.json file is the Output File, containing all the Results as Key-Value Pairs in this File.

<br/> <br/>
<b>Note:</b> Video of Running the Code, after uploading sample.csv is available in this <a href='Samarth_Data-Science_Week-2.ipynb-Video.mp4' target='_blank'>link</a> <br/>
As GitHub does not support playing videos of such length, you can download that video.
